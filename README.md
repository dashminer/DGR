Hello!

Are you by any chance creating a "Green" fork of DASH?

If yes, then I'd possibly would like to be on the team. I have some ideas as well.

Please find me on bitcointalk: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile or dashminerpool@gmail.com and lets discuss. I have some experience running a coin and lots of experience with programming.

Thanks
dashminer
